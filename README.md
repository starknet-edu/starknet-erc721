# Starknet ERC721, Part 1 - An Automated Workshop

## Introduction

Today, we are creating your first ERC721 from the ground up on Starknet. The ERC721 token standard stands for non-fungible tokens, also known as NFTs.

The contract interface of the ERC721 that you will need to follow can be found in `src/IERC721.cairo`. Please ensure that all the function names adhere to the IERC721 standard.

Now, let's get our hands dirty!

## What you will learn

- Understanding the basisc of an ERC721 contract
- How to create, implement and deploy an ERC721 contract
- How to interact with Evaluator Contract and validate the exercises

## Disclaimer

​Don’t expect any benefit from using this other than learning some cool stuff about Starknet, the first general-purpose Validity Rollup on the Ethereum mainnet.

## Steps

Your objective is to finish the tutorial, and collect all the points.You will mostly interact with the Evaluator contract which can be found in the table below.

### Counting your points and checking your progress

Your points will be credited to your wallet, though this may take some time. If you want to monitor your points count in real-time, you can also check your balance in a block explorer!

- Go to the ERC20 counter on [Voyager](https://goerli.voyager.online/contract/0x074b1195731222a7bcbb724d32b93d0c525e173b2c3e9722a2214b101c862801) or [Starkscan](https://testnet.starkscan.co/contract/0x074b1195731222a7bcbb724d32b93d0c525e173b2c3e9722a2214b101c862801) in the "read contract" tab.
- Enter your address in the `balanceOf` function.​

## Tasks list

### Exercise 1 - Deploying and initilizing your ERC721 (2 points)

1. Create your initial ERC721 contract. You will need the following:
   1. a constructor function that takes the `name` and `symbol` as input and then initializes the contract with those inputs
   2. a `get_name()` to receive the name of the ERC721
   3. a `get_symbol()` to receive the symbol of the ERC721
2. Assign a user slot from the Evaluator contract by calling `assign_user_slot()`
   1. Check the `get_user_slot()` to receive your number
   2. Based on your `user_slot` number, check the `get_info_name()` and `get_info_symbol()` to receive your unique `name` and `symbol`.
   3. use these values to initialize your ERC721
3. Deploy your contract on testnet
   1. make sure you use your given values based on the assigned user slot.
4. Call `submit_exercise()` in the Evaluator to configure the contract you want to be evaluated.
5. Call `ex_01_erc721_init()` to verify your contract and receive points.

### Exercise 2 - Minting a token (2 points)

Here, we will focus on minting your first NFT.

1. Create the `mint()` function that allows you to mint an NFT.
2. Deploy your contract on testnet
3. Call `submit_exercise()` in the Evaluator to configure the contract you want to be evaluated.
4. Call `ex_02_erc721_mint()` to verify your contract and receive points.

### Exercise 3 - Burning a token (2 points)

Here, we will focus on creating the burn function.

1. Create the `burn()` function that allows you to burn an NFT.
2. Deploy your contract on testnet
3. Call `submit_exercise()` in the Evaluator to configure the contract you want to be evaluated.
4. Send a token to the Evaluator contract by using the mint function from your deployed function.
5. Call `ex_03_erc721_burn()` to verify the `burn()` function within your contract and receive points.

### Exercise 4 - Approving a token (2 points)

This time, our job is to create the '`approve()` function, which can then be used to give permission to a specific contract address to interact with a specific NFT.

1. Create the `approve()` function.
2. Create the `get_approved()` function.
3. Deploy your contract on testnet.
4. Call `submit_exercise()` in the evaluator to configure the contract you want to be evaluated.
5. Call `ex_04_erc721_approve()` to verify your contract and receive points.

### Exercise 5 - Approve all function (2 points)

Here we will create the `set_approval_for_all()` function, which can then be used to give permission to a specific contract address to have full permission over our NFT contract.

1. Create the `set_approval_for_all()` function.
2. Create the `is_approved_for_all()` function.
3. Deploy your contract on testnet.
4. Call `submit_exercise()` in the evaluator to configure the contract you want to be evaluated.
5. Call `ex_05_erc721_approve_for_all()` to verify your contract and receive points.

### Exercise 6 - Transfering a token (2 points)

Here, we will focus on creating the transfer function.

1. Create the `transfer_from()` function that allows you to transfer the NFT.
2. Deploy your contract on testnet
3. Call `submit_exercise()` in the Evaluator to configure the contract you want to be evaluated.
4. Call `ex_06_erc721_transfer()` to verify your contract and receive points.
